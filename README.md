# 3D-Terrain-Generator

This is a 3D Procedural Terrain Generator application I've done for my bachelor thesis application.
The algorithms used to generate terrain are Diamond Square Algorithm and Perlin Noise based Algorithm.
It also offers binding of a 3D Bezier surface to the terrain so that the generated terrain(based on the 2 mentioned algorithms)
can be controlled by changing the positions of bezier control points.
Features:
  1) Control over all parameters of both algorithms.
  2) Control over bezier surface binded to the generated terrain
  3) Generic 5x5 convolutional filter to apply over terrain in N steps(specified from UI)
  4) Heightmap export as an image file
